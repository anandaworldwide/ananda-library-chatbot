# PHP Rules

- Use classes with strict types and interfaces (PHP 8+).
- Minimize global state, $_SESSION, static; favor dependency injection.
- Leverage PSR-12, Composer, and autoloading; PHPUnit for testing.
- Use attributes for routing/metadata, PSR-7 for HTTP handling.
- Optimize performance (OPcache, lazy loading, prepared statements).
- If there is a cache-busting version number, increment it when you make changes.
