# JavaScript and TypeScript

## General 
- Use `function` for pure functions, no semicolons.
- TypeScript (strict), interfaces over types, maps over enums.
- File structure: Component, subcomponents, helpers, static, types.
- Early returns, minimal braces, lowercase-dashed dirs.
- Named exports, RORO pattern.

## React/Next.js

- Functional components with TS interfaces.
- Minimize `use client`, `useEffect`, `setState`; favor RSC.
- Use Tailwind
- Suspense for client components, `next-safe-action` for server actions.
- Optimize images (WebP, lazy loading).

## Update tests
- After changing code, be sure to review and update related tests. 
- Run `npm run test:all` to make sure everything is working before you conclude your effort. 
- After creating new files or functions, ask the user whether they want you to add test coverage
