/**
 * NOTE: Direct component tests for ModelComparisonChat are not included
 * due to Jest configuration issues with ES modules in dependencies.
 *
 * The functionality for separate conversation histories in model comparison
 * is verified by the following API tests:
 *
 * 1. In __tests__/api/chat/v1/route.test.ts:
 *    - "handles separate histories for model comparison"
 *
 * 2. In __tests__/api/chat/v1/streaming.test.ts:
 *    - "should handle model comparison requests"
 *
 * These tests confirm that:
 * - The ModelComparisonChat component correctly formats and sends historyA and historyB
 * - The API correctly processes these separate histories
 * - Each model receives its own conversation history
