When you over-react, you take away the emotional space others need. The key to even-mindedness is to calm the reactive process. Catch yourself as soon as you start to react to a situation, while you still have time to control your mood swings. Control your mind with the immediate, decisive resolution to be even-minded and cheerful. It will help if you take time regularly to be quiet and to be in nature. Too much stimulation, like wind on a lake, creates ripples of turmoil in your mind. Remain even-minded in all circumstances, and you will be able to sail the ship of your life cheerfully over all seas, rough and calm alike. TRY THIS: Act, don't react. Be even-minded and cheerful no matter what happens. Day 27 - Gratitude",

                "text": "If you become too elated over success or cast down by setbacks, you are certain to become moody; and since negative emotions are contagious, you can spoil your work environment. When you over-react, you take away the emotional space others need. The key to even-mindedness is to calm the reactive process. Catch yourself as soon as you start to react to a situation, while you still have time to control your mood swings. Control your mind with the immediate, decisive resolution to be even-minded and cheerful. It will help if you take time regularly to be quiet and to be in nature. Too much stimulation, like wind on a lake, creates ripples of turmoil in your mind. Remain even-minded in all circumstances, and you will be able to sail the ship of your life cheerfully over all seas, rough and calm alike. TRY THIS: Act, don't react. Be even-minded and cheerful no matter what happens. Day 27 - Gratitude",

If you use astrology only for guidance in material matters, you will be doing its teachings an injustice. Astrology is the mathematics of your life, the mathematics of your actions. The relation of the stars to the human body and mind is very subtle. There is a relation of the spinal plexuses to the signs of the zodiac. No matter what environment you may live in, all the surrounding rays of the earth and universe react upon your body. You respond to those rays. There is a reaction between the stars and the rays around your body. Your body itself must be judged from the standpoint of your actions of the past and present.",

When you\u2019ve assimilated the subject, so it\u2019s a part of yourself, then you can talk to them; you focus on them instead of just what you\u2019re thinking. Then finally, when you\u2019re relaxed enough with your subject that you can think of them and what their needs are\u2014not just of what you know, but of what they don\u2019t know, and what they might come to know\u2014then you\u2019re really teaching. You need to tune in to the people and know where they are. Try to feel their thoughts, their vibrations, and then respond accordingly. Encourage student inquiry It\u2019s our responsibility to help students make the practice their very own\u2014not only by offering modifications as appropriate, but also by encouraging their inner exploration. Swamiji put it this way: As you practice each pose, do not ask yourself merely, \u201cWhat do the books say I should be feeling in this position?\u201d Feel, rather, what the total significance of the pose is",

This means that the focus is on personal spiritual experience rather than adherence to external religious structures.\n\nLove and Devotion: In Christianity, Jesus taught to love God with all one's heart, mind, strength, and soul. Similarly, Kriya Yoga requires love, devotion, and upliftment of consciousness as essential qualities for spiritual progress.\n\nThe Spine as a Battleground: Kriya Yoga teaches that the spine is the battleground where the seeds of karma are buried. By practicing Kriya Yoga, individuals can work on uplifting their consciousness and overcoming these karmic seeds.\n\nParallels in Symbolism: Swamiji highlights parallels between Christian symbols and those in Kriya Yoga. For example, the star of Bethlehem is likened to the star of the spiritual eye, and the sound of cosmic vibration (Aum) is seen as the Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit.\n\nTechniques as Keys to the Kingdom: The techniques of meditation in Kriya Yoga, such as those that open the chakras of the spine, are likened to the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. These techniques help raise the body's energy towards the highest centers in the brain, where the Kingdom of God is said to reside.",

(With Nayaswami Jyotish) Sunday Service at Ananda Village Nayaswami Jyotish , Nayaswami Jyotish and Nayaswami Devi June 5, 2022 Sunday Service with Nayaswami Jyotish and Nayaswami Devi at Ananda Village, recorded June 5th 2022. This week's reading from Swami Kriyananda's book \"Rays of the One Light\" is: Why Do Devotees Fall? Truth is one and eternal. Realize oneness with it in your deathless Self, within. The following commentary is based on the teachings of Paramhansa Yogananda. An endlessly fascinating question is, Why did Judas fall after receiving the extraordinary blessing of being accepted into the inner circle of Jesus Christ\u2019s disciples? For Judas was one of the twelve apostles. Yet he be-trayed Jesus, and earned for himself the opprobrium of Christendom for all futurity for his sin.

Matter is energy in a rate of vibration. But you and I, if we're not scientists, may say, well, how is this possible? All right, think of two things. One, the propeller on an airplane. When it moves fast enough, it looks solid, doesn't it? When a tuning fork moves back and forth, it looks as if the space between those two movements is solid. In other words, vibration gives the illusion of solidity. And in this universe, there are billions and trillions of different vibrations which make it seem as if we're living in a solid world, but it is not. And this is something that all the great masters have said. Everything is vibration. But it's more than vibration. Where did that energy come from ",

Meditation is that which will help you to be able under any circumstance to act and react appropriately. And in this case, very often, in fact, it will happen. You will feel, if you notice yourself becoming agitated because of anything that anyone said or anything that happened to you or whatever, you will notice that, first of all, there is an agitation in the feelings of your heart. I don't mean the physical heart, although that may be affected too if the emotion is very strong. But it",

As with other skills, the more you practice this, the more adept you will become. 3. First, shift your feelings into neutral, neither positive nor negative. The heart is the pivotal point from which the energy can flow in either an upward and expansive direction or a downward and contractive one. As in a car, you need to shift into neutral before you can move into forward or reverse. During my meditation, the relaxation and regular breathing shifted me into neutral, and from there I could redirect my energy upward. 4. If you want deeper meditations, change from thinking to observing: Watch the breath, listen to AUM, feel the Kriya currents, or look into the light of the spiritual eye. The spiritual states we yearn for lie behind the fringe of the mind. 5. Being able to control the reactive process imparts two huge benefits: the power to remain even-minded and cheerful, and the ability to choose to be happy in all situations.
