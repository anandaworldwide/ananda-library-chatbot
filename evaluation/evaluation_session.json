This means that the focus is on personal spiritual experience rather than adherence to external religious structures.\n\nLove and Devotion: In Christianity, Jesus taught to love God with all one's heart, mind, strength, and soul. Similarly, Kriya Yoga requires love, devotion, and upliftment of consciousness as essential qualities for spiritual progress.\n\nThe Spine as a Battleground: Kriya Yoga teaches that the spine is the battleground where the seeds of karma are buried. By practicing Kriya Yoga, individuals can work on uplifting their consciousness and overcoming these karmic seeds.\n\nParallels in Symbolism: Swamiji highlights parallels between Christian symbols and those in Kriya Yoga. For example, the star of Bethlehem is likened to the star of the spiritual eye, and the sound of cosmic vibration (Aum) is seen as the Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit.\n\nTechniques as Keys to the Kingdom: The techniques of meditation in Kriya Yoga, such as those that open the chakras of the spine, are likened to the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. These techniques help raise the body's energy towards the highest centers in the brain, where the Kingdom of God is said to reside.",
