It is also important, however, that Kriya Yoga be practiced with devotion and with high spiritual aspiration. Too much has been made in the yoga teachings of the importance of raising the kundalini, or the subtle energy in the spine, by merely mechanical methods. By merely mechanical methods.

However, a general understanding of the yogic science underlying the Kriya technique is important in learning how to practice Kriya the most correctly and deeply. The Astral Spine and Breath As a spiritual technique, Kriya is universal because it works directly with inner realities shared by everyone. Even though the practice has a physical component, the technique works more on the astral body than the physical body. The effectiveness of Kriya is based on the connection between the physical breath and the \"astral breath.\" By increasing the awareness of that connection, and by stimulating the energy in the astral spine, the Kriya Yogi gradually gains control of that energy.

Kriya Yoga practice is the ultimate fire ceremony and religious ritual, because it goes directly to the source, in the deep spine, of all karmic involvement and delusion.

The chakras are key energy points in the astral spine, and are fully described in The Art & Science of Raja Yoga .

It should be added that he did indeed offer Kriya that way for those who could not come and take it in person. As we saw in the case of Professor Novicky, in Prague, Yogananda's blessings could be received from afar. Nevertheless, the guru's touch is important for final success in this practice. As Yogananda wrote in his poem \" Samadhi ,\" that inner blessing is essential on the path. The lines read: \"By deeper, longer, thirsty, guru-given meditation comes this celestial samadhi .\" Yogananda said, \"Jesus Christ knew, practiced, and taught Kriya Yoga, or a technique very much like it.\"",

Do we mean one of the many types of intelligences outlined by Howard Gardner, such as linguistic or spatial? Is intelligence being able to learn a foreign language or the ability to repair a car? Or is intelligence the ability to learn from experience and change one ' s behavior? Just as the word intelligence can represent multiple realities, so can the word energy. In fact, I would like to introduce one more unusual meaning for the word energy, and that is willingness . When we have more energy, we are more willing, and the opposite when we have less. I will discuss this further in chapters four and five. To get the most out of the Keys to Energy in this book, it would be helpful to relax any rigid definition for energy and do your best to feel",

What did this look like? No matter what he was doing, he was inwardly still. Even practicing the Energization Exercises - with their many movements - you could feel his deep stillness. Swamiji gave thousands of lectures, each one involving a great deal of speaking. Yet, as he often pointed out, he was always listening to the audience - what did they need to hear? I saw Swami speak from inner listening directly in my own life and indirectly in accounts related by others. Sometimes when Swamiji was speaking to a small or large group of people, he would say something seemingly unrelated, or even strange.

This is a bit confusing to people because you think, well, I'm breathing in and that means the air is going down, whereas in fact the energy is coming upward. You could think of it, if you like, therefore, as the breath coming in but therefore filling the lungs from the bottom up, as if you were filling a glass from a pitcher. It would start at the bottom and move upward. You can think of it that way, if you like, just as a means of helping to break that little thought that has caused confusion in some minds.

Exhalation is a corresponding downward movement through pingala . In the physical body, the actual cause of our emotional reactive process is that flow of energy through ida and pingala .

The ratio between breath and impure venous blood is: The greater the amount of dark blood, the greater the necessity for breath. If there is no dark blood in the body through the prevention of the waste of bodily tissues, as in suspended animation by conscious rest given to the bodily cells, then there is no necessity for breathing. For this reason the Hindu Masters taught how to control the Life Force in the heart by stopping decay in the body and producing the resultant breathless state, and not to hold the breath in the lungs indefinitely. Controlling the Life Force in the body enables one to switch off the current from the nerve sense-telephones, thus making it impossible for disturbing sensations to reach the brain and to distract the attention from marching toward its Maker, or toward the Divine Goal. The mortal breath, which binds the Soul to the body, cannot be done away with by forcibly holding it in the lungs, but only by stopping decay in the ",

I've never seen such desires, if pursued as an alternative to seeking God, end in anything but disappointment. Unfortunately, these desires can be so strong that even the guru's warning is of no avail. There were two disciples of Yogananda, for example, who talked of very worldly things while returning from Encinitas on the bus. When they arrived at the gateway of Mount Washington, Yogananda met them and repeated everything they had said. He told them, \"Don't mix with each other.\" Unfortunately, they didn't listen and fed each other's weaknesses by talking of worldly desires, which eventually resulted in their leaving the ashram.",

If you use astrology only for guidance in material matters, you will be doing its teachings an injustice. Astrology is the mathematics of your life, the mathematics of your actions. The relation of the stars to the human body and mind is very subtle. There is a relation of the spinal plexuses to the signs of the zodiac. No matter what environment you may live in, all the surrounding rays of the earth and universe react upon your body. You respond to those rays. There is a reaction between the stars and the rays around your body. Your body itself must be judged from the standpoint of your actions of the past and present.",

The heart is the pivotal point from which the energy can flow in either an upward and expansive direction or a downward and contractive one. As in a car, you need to shift into neutral before you can move into forward or reverse. During my meditation, the relaxation and regular breathing shifted me into neutral, and from there I could redirect my energy upward. 4. If you want deeper meditations, change from thinking to observing: Watch the breath, listen to AUM, feel the Kriya currents, or look into the light of the spiritual eye. The spiritual states we yearn for lie behind the fringe of the mind. 5.

Seclusions are usually a time for going deeper in meditation, but I began mine in a discouraged state. Certain recurring, negative thoughts had followed me into seclusion. Whenever I tried to meditate, I was assailed by thoughts of my imperfections as a devotee and the notion that I wasn't \"good enough\" to meditate well. After two days of this, I became so desperate to escape the tyranny of my mind that I decided to take charge.
