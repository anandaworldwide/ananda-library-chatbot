It is also important, however, that Kriya Yoga be practiced with devotion and with high spiritual aspiration. Too much has been made in the yoga teachings of the importance of raising the kundalini, or the subtle energy in the spine, by merely mechanical methods. By merely mechanical methods.

However, a general understanding of the yogic science underlying the Kriya technique is important in learning how to practice Kriya the most correctly and deeply. The Astral Spine and Breath As a spiritual technique, Kriya is universal because it works directly with inner realities shared by everyone. Even though the practice has a physical component, the technique works more on the astral body than the physical body. The effectiveness of Kriya is based on the connection between the physical breath and the \"astral breath.\" By increasing the awareness of that connection, and by stimulating the energy in the astral spine, the Kriya Yogi gradually gains control of that energy.

Kriya Yoga practice is the ultimate fire ceremony and religious ritual, because it goes directly to the source, in the deep spine, of all karmic involvement and delusion. The devotional self-offering made during deep Kriya practice can be much more effective than any outward ceremony or offering. The chakras are key energy points in the astral spine, and are fully described in The Art & Science of Raja Yoga .

It should be added that he did indeed offer Kriya that way for those who could not come and take it in person. As we saw in the case of Professor Novicky, in Prague, Yogananda's blessings could be received from afar. Nevertheless, the guru's touch is important for final success in this practice. As Yogananda wrote in his poem \" Samadhi ,\" that inner blessing is essential on the path. The lines read: \"By deeper, longer, thirsty, guru-given meditation comes this celestial samadhi .\" Yogananda said, \"Jesus Christ knew, practiced, and taught Kriya Yoga, or a technique very much like it.\"",

Do we mean one of the many types of intelligences outlined by Howard Gardner, such as linguistic or spatial? Is intelligence being able to learn a foreign language or the ability to repair a car? Or is intelligence the ability to learn from experience and change one ' s behavior? Just as the word intelligence can represent multiple realities, so can the word energy. In fact, I would like to introduce one more unusual meaning for the word energy, and that is willingness . When we have more energy, we are more willing, and the opposite when we have less. I will discuss this further in chapters four and five. To get the most out of the Keys to Energy in this book, it would be helpful to relax any rigid definition for energy and do your best to feel",

These rays, according to the rate of their vibration, became Gases, Liquids, Solids. The definition of Solid is frozen Liquid. Liquid is frozen Gas. Gas is frozen Rays. Rays are frozen Electricity. Electricity is Frozen Energy. At the same time you can see that what is solid is frozen vibration or energy; liquid is liquid energy; gas is gaseous energy. These are all forms of energy.

Though I felt I had little to share, I did write the letter; Swami contacted me to say he liked what I had written. I ' ve been reflecting on how Swamiji was always LISTENING. What did this look like? No matter what he was doing, he was inwardly still. Even practicing the Energization Exercises - with their many movements - you could feel his deep stillness. Swamiji gave thousands of lectures, each one involving a great deal of speaking. Yet, as he often pointed out, he was always listening to the audience - what did they need to hear? I saw Swami speak from inner listening directly in my own life and indirectly in accounts related by others. Sometimes when Swamiji was speaking to a small or large group of people, he would say something seemingly unrelated, or even strange. Yet there would be one person in the audience for whom it was a particularly enlightening comment.",

I think because of all the work on the book, and who knows what other reasons, I kept forgetting to concentrate on the words. Many times Swamiji has told us that when you teach, above all you should give people your vibrations. Sitting in the theater on Saturday was an interesting experience of the difference between words and vibrations. I was totally engaged in his talk. I wasn't at all bored or restless. I was listening to every word and receiving from him a great sense of communication and even of meaning, although it was nonverbal meaning, for every so often it occurred to me that I hadn't understood any of the words. They were sound vibrations that came in to me on that level. This really helped me to understand how secondary the intellectual, verbal part of communicating can be, especially when what Swamiji conveys, above all, is a state of consciousness.",
