The important thing is that God created this physical world, this material universe, out of energy, and that energy has intelligence. It takes intelligence for the energy in your body to take the food from your intestines and direct it towards specific functions so that the molecules take on particular forms, nails on the hand, hair on the head, soft tissue in the muscles, blood vessels, etc., etc. The same food goes out and performs all these different functions, takes on all these different forms because there is intelligence guiding them. And it isn't you who are guiding them, it isn't you who say, your own energy can certainly influence how that energy works so ",

When his mind becomes very calm and focused, the meditator can see the spiritual eye as a golden ring enclosing a deep-blue field with a silvery-white five-pointed star at its center. Seeing the spiritual eye clearly is challenging, and many people get disheartened if they can't. Don't get discouraged. Any perception of the inner light, even as only a kind of ephemeral opalescence, is extremely beneficial. The inner light can deepen our meditation in many ways. Typically, we begin our meditation by praying to God and our line of gurus. Unfortunately, this is often done absentmindedly. It will be much more effective if you first take a few moments to center yourself and connect to the light and energy in the spiritual eye. Then, as you pray, clearly visualize each of the masters, especially their eyes. It adds even more power if you also feel and direct devotional gratitude to each of them from the heart.",

When his mind becomes very calm and focused, the meditator can see the spiritual eye as a golden ring enclosing a deep-blue field with a silvery-white five-pointed star at its center. Seeing the spiritual eye clearly is challenging, and many people get disheartened if they can't. Don't get discouraged. Any perception of the inner light, even as only a kind of ephemeral opalescence, is extremely beneficial. The inner light can deepen our meditation in many ways. Typically, we begin our meditation by praying to God and our line of gurus. Unfortunately, this is often done absentmindedly. It will be much more effective if you first take a few moments to center yourself and connect to the light and energy in the spiritual eye. Then, as you pray, clearly visualize each of the masters, especially their eyes. It adds even more power if you also feel and direct devotional gratitude to each of them from the heart.",

It's not a question of, oh, you expect to see this in Master's path, and therefore you see the spiritual eye, which he described as a golden aureole with a blue field inside it and a five-pointed silvery white star in the center.

If you use astrology only for guidance in material matters, you will be doing its teachings an injustice. Astrology is the mathematics of your life, the mathematics of your actions. The relation of the stars to the human body and mind is very subtle. There is a relation of the spinal plexuses to the signs of the zodiac. No matter what environment you may live in, all the surrounding rays of the earth and universe react upon your body. You respond to those rays. There is a reaction between the stars and the rays around your body. Your body itself must be judged from the standpoint of your actions of the past and present.",

Of the great sages of our time whose concern for mankind has led them to make important world prophecies, one was Paramahansa [sic] Yogananda, author of the famous spiritual classic, Autobiography of a Yogi. Yogananda lived for over thirty years in the West, teaching and inspiring countless thousands of people. In 1925, in Los Angeles, he founded the headquarters of the still-flourishing organization, Self-Realization Fellowship, which now has numerous branch centers in many parts of the world.",

I think because of all the work on the book, and who knows what other reasons, I kept forgetting to concentrate on the words. Many times Swamiji has told us that when you teach, above all you should give people your vibrations. Sitting in the theater on Saturday was an interesting experience of the difference between words and vibrations. I was totally engaged in his talk. I wasn't at all bored or restless. I was listening to every word and receiving from him a great sense of communication and even of meaning, although it was nonverbal meaning, for every so often it occurred to me that I hadn't understood any of the words. They were sound vibrations that came in to me on that level. This really helped me to understand how secondary the intellectual, verbal part of communicating can be, especially when what Swamiji conveys, above all, is a state of consciousness.",

Maybe I could do what I've done. After all, I wrote many stories about him in my book, The Path. I edited his book, The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam Explained. I put out a book of Essence of Self-Realization, which is of Yogananda's sayings. And my whole life has been dedicated not only to teaching Yogananda's teachings, but specifically to expounding on the concepts in this book. It's sort of the spine, you might say, ",

This means that the focus is on personal spiritual experience rather than adherence to external religious structures.\n\nLove and Devotion: In Christianity, Jesus taught to love God with all one's heart, mind, strength, and soul. Similarly, Kriya Yoga requires love, devotion, and upliftment of consciousness as essential qualities for spiritual progress.\n\nThe Spine as a Battleground: Kriya Yoga teaches that the spine is the battleground where the seeds of karma are buried. By practicing Kriya Yoga, individuals can work on uplifting their consciousness and overcoming these karmic seeds.\n\nParallels in Symbolism: Swamiji highlights parallels between Christian symbols and those in Kriya Yoga. For example, the star of Bethlehem is likened to the star of the spiritual eye, and the sound of cosmic vibration (Aum) is seen as the Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit.\n\nTechniques as Keys to the Kingdom: The techniques of meditation in Kriya Yoga, such as those that open the chakras of the spine, are likened to the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. These techniques help raise the body's energy towards the highest centers in the brain, where the Kingdom of God is said to reside.",

Jesus Christ expressed this teaching in the following words: \"Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.\" He was offering the mental corollary to the teaching of yoga. Indeed, without that mental corollary yogic breathing exercises would have little effect. Many yoga students make the mistake of focusing so completely on their techniques that they forget the need for right attitude.

When it moves fast enough, it looks solid, doesn't it? When a tuning fork moves back and forth, it looks as if the space between those two movements is solid. In other words, vibration gives the illusion of solidity. And in this universe, there are billions and trillions of different vibrations which make it seem as if we're living in a solid world, but it is not.

Matter is energy in a rate of vibration. But you and I, if we're not scientists, may say, well, how is this possible? All right, think of two things. One, the propeller on an airplane. When it moves fast enough, it looks solid, doesn't it? When a tuning fork moves back and forth, it looks as if the space between those two movements is solid. In other words, vibration gives the illusion of solidity. And in this universe, there are billions and trillions of different vibrations which make it seem as if we're living in a solid world, but it is not. And this is something that all the great masters have said. Everything is vibration. But it's more than vibration. Where did that energy come from ",

Originally these fourteen lessons were mailed out one at a time, every two weeks for twenty-eight weeks. You may find that two weeks is just about the right amount of time to spend on each lesson. Perhaps you'll want to go faster! But slower might be better, in order to have time to really savor the depths of these teachings, and, more importantly, to start actually doing them. In a way, The Art and Science of Raja Yoga is a lifetime study. You can re-read the book, or parts of it, repeatedly, whenever you want to re-inspire yourself to go more deeply into your yoga and meditation practices. The course can also be used as a reference book; you'll find a comprehensive index at the end.",
