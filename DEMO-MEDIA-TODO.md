# Demo Videos & Animated GIFs Implementation Plan

**Objective**: Enhance README visibility and engagement by incorporating demo videos and animated GIFs showcasing all 5
sites running on the open source codebase.

**Strategy**: Hybrid approach combining immediate visual impact in README (Option 1) with detailed demos page (Option 4)
for maintainability and scalability.

**Demo Mode Integration**: Cookie-based demo mode allows safe demonstration of admin interfaces without exposing real
user data. Enable via `?demo=1` URL parameter.
