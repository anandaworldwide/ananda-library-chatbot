   ```bash
   pyenv virtualenv 3.12.3 ananda-library-chatbot
   ```

4. Activate it automatically when you enter the directory:

   ```bash
   pyenv local ananda-library-chatbot
   ```

5. Install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Python Code Quality and Linting

This project uses [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for Python linting and formatting. The configuration follows
PEP 8 standards and includes automatic fixing of common issues.

**Setup for VS Code/Cursor:**

1. Install the Ruff extension: Search for "Ruff" by Charlie Marsh in the Extensions panel
2. The project includes pre-configured settings in `.vscode/settings.json` that will:
   - Enable Ruff as the default linter and formatter
   - Auto-fix issues on save
   - Organize imports automatically
   - Show linting errors in the Problems panel

**Manual linting commands:**

```bash
# Check for linting issues
ruff check .

# Fix auto-fixable issues
ruff check --fix .

# Format code
ruff format .
```

**Note for contributors:** If VS Code/Cursor doesn't auto-detect your Python interpreter, refer to
`.vscode/settings.json.example` for guidance on setting the interpreter path for your specific environment.

### Ingesting from WordPress Database (Recommended for WP Sites)

This is the primary method for ingesting content originating from a WordPress database. It directly transfers content,
calculated metadata (author, permalink), and **categories** (from specified taxonomies) into Pinecone.

**(Optional) Import MySQL Dump Details:**

The `bin/process_anandalib_dump.py` script helps prepare and import a WordPress SQL dump:

```bash
python bin/process_anandalib_dump.py -u [mysql_username] [path_to_sql_dump]
```

This script (originally for Ananda Library) creates a dated database (e.g., `anandalib-YYYY-MM-DD`), performs some
preprocessing, and imports the data. It can be adapted for other WordPress dumps.

**Main Steps:**

1. **Ensure Database Access:** Make sure the MySQL connection details (`DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`) are
   correctly configured in your `.env.[site]` file for the target database.
2. **Import Dump (if necessary):** If working with a dump file, use the `bin/process_anandalib_dump.py` script to import
   it into a local MySQL database (see details below).
3. **Run the Ingestion Script:** Execute the `ingest_db_text.py` script:

   ```bash
   python python/data_ingestion/sql-to-vector-db/ingest_db_text.py --site [site] --database [database_name] \
     --library-name "[Library Name]"
   ```

   - `--site`: Your site configuration name (e.g., `ananda`) used for `.env` loading and site-specific settings (like
     base URL, post types, category taxonomy).
   - `--database`: The name of the MySQL database containing the WordPress data.
   - `--library-name`: The name to assign to this library within Pinecone metadata.
   - `--keep-data` (optional): Add this flag to resume ingestion from the last checkpoint. If omitted (or `False`), the
     script will prompt you to confirm deletion of existing vectors for the specified library name before starting
     fresh.
   - `--batch-size` (optional): Number of documents to process in each embedding/upsert batch (default: 50).

4. **Monitor Progress:** The script will show progress bars for data preparation and batch processing.
5. **Verify in Pinecone:** Check your Pinecone dashboard to confirm vectors have been added with the correct metadata,
   including the `categories` field.

### Ingesting Standalone PDF Files

Use this method for PDF files that _do not_ originate from the WordPress database.

1. Place your PDF files (or folders containing them) inside a designated directory (e.g., create
   `pdf-docs/[library-name]/`).
2. Run the ingestion script using one of these commands:

   ```bash
   # Standard ingestion
   npm run ingest:pdf -- --file-path ./pdf-docs/my-library --site [site] --library-name "My Library Name"

   # With deprecation warnings
   npm run ingest:pdf:trace -- --file-path ./pdf-docs/my-library --site [site] --library-name "My Library Name"
   ```

   Arguments:

   - `--file-path`: Path to the directory containing the PDFs
   - `--site`: Your site configuration name (for `.env` loading)
   - `--library-name`: Name for this library in Pinecone
   - `--keep-data` (optional): Resume from checkpoint

3. Check Pinecone dashboard to verify vectors.

### Ingesting from WordPress Database

For WordPress database ingestion, use the Python script directly:

```bash
python data_ingestion/sql_to_vector_db/ingest_db_text.py --site [site] --database [database_name] \
  --library-name "[Library Name]"
```

Arguments:

- `--site`: Your site configuration name (e.g., `ananda`) used for `.env` loading and site-specific settings
- `--database`: The name of the MySQL database containing the WordPress data
- `--library-name`: The name to assign to this library within Pinecone metadata
- `--keep-data` (optional): Resume ingestion from the last checkpoint
- `--batch-size` (optional): Number of documents to process in each embedding/upsert batch (default: 50)
- `--dry-run` (optional): Perform all steps except Pinecone operations

### Crawl Websites and Convert to Embeddings

This repo includes a script to crawl websites and ingest their content.

1. Run the script `python python/data_ingestion/crawler/website_crawler.py` with appropriate arguments.

   ```bash
   python python/data_ingestion/crawler/website_crawler.py --domain yourdomain.com --site [site]
   ```

   - `--domain`: The domain to crawl (e.g., `ananda.org`).
   - `--site`: The site configuration name (e.g., `ananda-public`) used for `.env` file loading.
   - `--continue`: Resume crawling from the last saved checkpoint.
   - `--retry-failed`: Retry URLs that failed in the previous run.
   - `--active-hours`: Specify active crawling times (e.g., `9pm-6am`).
   - `--report`: Generate a report of failed URLs from the last checkpoint and exit.

2. Check Pinecone dashboard to verify vectors have been added for the crawled content.

### Transcribe MP3 files and YouTube videos and convert to embeddings

Put your MP3 files in `data-ingestion/media/`, in subfolders. Create a list of YouTube videos or playlists. Then add
files to the processing queue and process them.

#### Audio files

Add all audio files in a folder hierarchy like this:

```bash
python ingest_queue.py  --audio 'media/to-process' --author 'Swami Kriyananda' --library 'Ananda Sangha' --site ananda
```

#### YouTube playlists

You can add a whole playlist at a time. Or you can give it individual videos.

```bash
python ingest_queue.py \
 --playlist 'https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr4btvSEPHax_vE48QrYJUYOKpXbeSmfC' \
 --author 'Swami Kriyananda' --library 'Ananda Sangha' --site ananda
```

`--playlists-file` is an option to specify an Excel file with a list of YouTube playlists. See sample file
`youtube-links-sample.xlsx`.

Then process the queue:

```bash
python data_ingestion/audio_video/transcribe_and_ingest_media.py
```

Check Pinecone dashboard to verify your namespace and vectors have been added.

## Troubleshooting

In general, keep an eye out in the `issues` and `discussions` section of this repo for solutions.

### General errors

- Make sure you're running the latest Node version. Run `node -v`
- Try a different PDF or convert your PDF to text first. It's possible your PDF is corrupted, scanned, or requires OCR
  to convert to text.
- `Console.log` the `env` variables and make sure they are exposed.
- Make sure you're using the same versions of LangChain and Pinecone as this repo.
- Check that you've created an `.env.[site]` file that contains your valid (and working) API keys, environment and index
  name.
- If you change `modelName` in `OpenAI`, make sure you have access to the api for the appropriate model.
- Make sure you have enough OpenAI credits and a valid card on your billings account.
- Check that you don't have multiple OPENAPI keys in your global environment. If you do, the local `env` file from the
  project will be overwritten by systems `env` variable.
- Try to hard code your API keys into the `process.env` variables if there are still issues.

### Pinecone errors

- Make sure your pinecone dashboard `environment` and `index` matches the one in the `pinecone.ts` and `.env` files.
- Check that you've set the vector dimensions env var OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_DIMENSION appropriately (e.g., 1536 or 3072).
- Retry from scratch with a new Pinecone project, index, and cloned repo.

## Adding a new site

1. Copy `site-config/config.json` to `site-config/config.[site].json`
2. Edit the new config file with your site's details
3. Write your system prompt in site-config/prompts/[site]-prompt.txt. Be sure above config file references the correct
   prompt for your site.
4. Create .env.[site] and add your site's API keys. Be sure to get a unique GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS for your
   site.

## Using S3 for Prompts (Optional)

You can store prompt files in AWS S3 instead of the local filesystem. The system will load files:

- With `s3:` prefix from your S3 bucket
- Without prefix from the local filesystem

**Note:** Currently, S3 prompt files are shared between development and production environments. Be cautious when making
changes as they will affect all environments immediately.

1. Configure S3 access in your .env file:

   ```env
   AWS_REGION=us-west-1
   S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```

2. In your site's prompt config (e.g. `site-config/prompts/[site].json`), prefix S3-stored files with `s3:`:

   ```json
   {
     "templates": {
       "baseTemplate": {
         "file": "s3:your-site-base.txt" // Will load from S3
       },
       "localTemplate": {
         "file": "local-file.txt" // Will load from local filesystem
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Managing S3 Prompts:

   ```bash
   # Pull a prompt from S3 (and acquire lock)
   npm run prompt [site] pull [filename]

   # Edit the local copy (uses VS Code, $EDITOR, or vim)
   npm run prompt [site] edit [filename]

   # See differences between local and S3 version
   npm run prompt [site] diff [filename]

   # Push changes back to S3 (and release lock)
   npm run prompt [site] push [filename]
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   # Full workflow example
   npm run prompt ananda-public pull ananda-public-base.txt
   npm run prompt ananda-public edit ananda-public-base.txt
   npm run prompt ananda-public diff ananda-public-base.txt
   npm run prompt ananda-public push ananda-public-base.txt
   ```

   Features:

   - 5-minute file locking to prevent concurrent edits
   - Automatic versioning through S3 versioning
   - Local staging directory (.prompts-staging)
   - Uses VS Code if available, falls back to $EDITOR or vim
   - Diff command to review changes before pushing

4. Files are stored in the `site-config/prompts/` directory in your S3 bucket
